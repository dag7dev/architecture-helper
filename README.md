## Getting Started

To get this program clone it with git via:

```
git clone https://github.com/dag7dev/hit-miss-cache-calc.git
```

Otherwise if you're not familiar with git you can download it as a zip from
[Here](https://github.com/dag7dev/hit-miss-cache-calc/archive/master.zip).


### Prerequisites

To run this program you need Python, wich you can install from
[Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

This program was written for Python 3.8.3, but *hopefully* it should be compatible with future versions of Python too as it uses really few imports.


### Running

To run the program simply run:
```
main.py
```

### Parameters

You can look at the available parameters by running:
```
main.py -h
```

The output should be something like this:
```
Usage: 
        no parameters: 
                interactive mode - write your own data
        -t: 
                test mode - work with an example - no other parameter needed
        -f filename: 
                file mode - import data from a json file - you shall pass the filename
        -h: 
                help mode - you are reading this!
```

**NOTE:** Keep in mind that the [README](./README.md) could be not always updated with the latest parameters, so always refer to the output of `main.py -h` rather that what's written here.
